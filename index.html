			<h1 class="resume1head">Summary</h1>
			<p class="resmaintext">Graduated from the University of Warwick with a first class Master of Mathematics and an award for outstanding academic achievement. 
			Currently, I work on the lightends trading desk at Castleton Commodities International where I am utilising my mathematical and programming experience in 
			quantitative analysis and trading strategies. Previously, I supported the origination team at Centrica in advising clients, offering new ideas, valuing deals 
			and discovering opportunities.</p>
			<p class="resmaintext">Studying mathematics has refined my analytical skills and my clear aptitude for understanding and solving complex problems can be
			shown both by my final year project on Ergodic Theory and research using stochastic analysis applied to mathematical finance, which I carried out in my spare time.
			Furthermore, I continually strive to widen my experience in other technical areas such as programming. I have completed various projects including building
			my own website, developing a back-testing framework in MATLAB using object oriented programming and completing an online course in machine learning.</p>
			<p class="resmaintext">My ability to use enthusiasm and creativity to succeed in a variety of organisations, despite being in pressurised situations, demonstrates
			versatility. Finally, I am passionate about contributing to the communities I belong to, displayed by my activities in Athena Swan and teaching in South Africa.</p>

							an explicit formula for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of any circulant matrix and
							a brief introduction to the discrete Fourier transform. 
							The essay then goes on to discuss two applications. Firstly, we use the properties of circulant matrices to give a unified approach to solving polynomials and secondly,
							we discuss the role of circulant matrices in solving particular systems of linear equations.
